## 📖 About The Project  
This repository showcases my Java learning journey, progressing from simple programs to complex object‑oriented systems. Each file builds on prior concepts, helping reinforce programming fundamentals, data structures, and best practices.

**Key Features:**  
- **Structured Learning Path:** Start from basic programs and advance to OOP and real‑world systems.  
- **Real‑World Projects:** Student management, payroll system, and interactive mini‑games.  
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Arrays, ArrayLists, Collections, conditional logic, loops, and OOP principles.  
- **Production‑Ready Code:** Modular, well‑documented, and maintainable Java code.

Go ahead and replace your current `README.md` with this version. If you like, I can **create a custom banner image** (for your repo header) that features your logo (the ‘R’ with star) and integrate it into the README with markup. Shall I set that up next?
